Project Description:
This is a machine learning-based Email Spam Detection project that aims to classify emails as either "spam" or "non-spam" (ham). Email spam is a prevalent issue, and this project seeks to develop an effective model that can automatically identify and filter out unwanted spam emails from users' inboxes.

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled emails, with each email categorized as either spam or non-spam. We will leverage this labeled data to train and evaluate the machine learning model.
Key Steps and Components:

Data Preprocessing:

Load and explore the email dataset.Perform data cleaning, including removing unnecessary headers, formatting, and any other noise.

Model Selection:

Evaluate various machine learning algorithms suitable for binary classification, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, or Naive Bayes.
Utilize cross-validation techniques to select the best performing model.

Model Training and Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the selected model on the training data.
